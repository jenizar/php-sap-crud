 PHP-SAP database CRUD application
 
Intro:
In the PHP-SAP database CRUD application there is a process of create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) the data in SAP. This application uses an SAP SAP service connection (HTTP) that is connected to the SAP BSP Application. Every CRUD function that is called by PHP will be served by the ABAP program contained in the BSP Application which acts as an event handler (oninitialization).
